# CFS Options Pages

This plugin allows you to create options pages for use with Custom Field Suite. Although it works, and is relatively stable, the code will probably change a fair bit over the coming days/weeks and it's not recommended for use in production unless you're absolutely sure you know what you're doing.

## How?

The plugin defines an array of options pages (by page title) as `$this->options_pages`. We register a default page, simply titled 'Options', and you can add to that list if you have multiple types of options to manage.

After the pages are created, you can link them to CFS field groups within CFS's UI.
